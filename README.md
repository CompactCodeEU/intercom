This free module for Magento 2Â© provides a intercom chat function integration. Intercom is a great communication platform for you and your customers. When customers are logged in every chat will be handled with their account so you can track their questions. It is possible to expand the functionality that we have with your own code or ask for custom development since this module already uses the Intercom JS API!

 
A chat function on your website is a must have these days. This free module will provide just that with the help of Intercom.
